== What Is Session Snapshots?

Session Snapshots is a tool introduced by Kobiton to make your experience with NOVA even more seamless and convenient. Session Snapshots is a series of screenshots taken of your test for you to review: these screenshots are an action-by-action display of the gestures and interactions made during your primary manual test that begins your NOVA test execution, as well as your NOVA “revisit” tests made as scriptless automated recreations of your primary manual test.

Each step of your test will be displayed in a screenshot, with the element your test interacts with highlighted in a purple box. The status of your test as a success or failure will be displayed. If your revisited tests fail or encounter a blocking step that prevents the test from completing, that blocking step will be marked and a “Resolve Blocker” option will be displayed so that you can work together with Kobiton to repair and resolve your test scenario.

== How Does It Work?
Session Snapshots is an automatic feature of NOVA; once you have completed a manual session and confirmed that you would like a suite of NOVA tests to be built from that manual session, you will be able to access the Test Run page for your test. This is where Session Snapshots will be displayed.

NOTE: NOVA is currently only available for test runs involving third-party installed applications for testing; tests performed using only native OS apps will not be viable for NOVA testing. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough to assist you with your use of Session Snapshots.

Below is the step-by-step instruction to assist you with your use of Session Snapshots.

=== Run a Manual Session

Before running an automation test, you must create a manual session that performs the steps of your desired automated test.

Click link:https://support.kobiton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057791431-Getting-Started-with-Manual-Testing[here] to explore how to run a Manual Testing with Kobiton Portal.

=== Navigate to Automated Test Case
There are two ways to access the *Automated Test Case* page:

1. On the Sessions page, locate the session you wish to view and click on it. You will be redirected to the *Session Overview* page as seen below. Then, click the *Automated Test Case*.

+
If you visit the *Session Overview* the second time, click on the NOVA icon next to the Jira Integration.
+

2. The second method  is to right-click on the session which you wish to work, select *View Test Run*.
+

+
In the *Automated Test Case* window, if you see the message *"Congratulations! Your test is good to go now"*, click *Rerun*.
+

+
If you encounter a warning, you must annotate overlapped elements before *Rerun*. Unsolved overlapped elements are marked with red indicators.

Check the article xref:session-snapshot/overlapped-element.adoc[Overlapped Element] to explore how to Annotate.

=== Select Device Bundles

In the *Rerun Configurations* window, select devices in the list of *Device Bundles*, then click the *Rerun* button.

After selecting the Device Bundles, you will see these prompts immediately from the right side.

=== Check the Scriptless result
Once NOVA has completed a suite of automated tests for you, the results will be displayed at the top of the Test Run page with the title of *"Test case generated from <manual session ID>"*. Session Snapshots will display an overview of your NOVA test runs (only the suite connected to your selected primary manual session), your primary manual test Snapshots at the top of the page, and the Snapshots of the results of your automated tests.

Scroll down you see the details of the automation test cases. Each test will be listed separately according to the device and marked with the name of the device.
Test steps executed on the device is marked with a separate screenshot and purple indicators (arrows for swipe, dots for click/press, etc.) for any gestures performed. Scroll right to view all the snapshots.

You will also see an overview displayed for the suite of automated tests (you can name a suite's test run, or the default will be "Test Run #1, Test Run #2, etc. ...". The steps the test performed and their accompanying screenshots will be displayed in the Snapshot box.

Clicking the hyperlink of Session ID will redirect you to the *Session Overview* page for that session.

=== Check the test status

The status of the test (Pass, Fail, Queue up or Block) will be shown in the test Snapshot box.

1. If a test passes, you will see the Snapshots displayed with the "Pass" status like in the image below.
+

+

6. If a test fails, the snapshots will display all of the test steps that were successfully completed; if a step was unable to be performed, the screenshot will be empty. If the test fails and NOVA does not detect the possibility of a blocker, the test will fail without the possibility of remediation.
+

7. If a test returns a Blocked status, instead of a screenshot, you will see a notification box in the place of the screenshot for the blocked step. Clicking *Resolve Blocker* in the blocker notification box will take you to the *Blocker Remediation* page.
+

=== Resolve Blocker

The *Blocker Remediation* page is where you can make attempts to resolve blocked steps in your automated tests.

image::blocker remediation.png[]

On the right, NOVA displays the expected/successful screenshot from the primary manual test, and the correlative screenshot that was taken in the automated test that resulted in a blocker. You can compare these screenshots to determine how you would like to attempt remediation.

On the left is the Blocker Remediation box with two default selections: *Action* and *Scope*. *"Action"* defines how would like to proceed with remediation in a retest. *"Scope"* defines the expected scope that NOVA will apply to the remediation action.

The remediation options will be discussed in a separate article xref:session-snapshot/blocker remediation.adoc[Blocker Remediation].


Once you have defined your remediation parameters, click the *Submit* button. Once your remediation has been submitted, NOVA will automatically begin a retest. You will be taken back to the *Test Run* page.
