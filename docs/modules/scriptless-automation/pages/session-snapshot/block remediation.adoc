:navtitle: Block Remediation

The blocker remediation page is where you can make attempts to resolve blocked steps in your automated tests.


== Overview
The blocker remediation column has two default selections: *Action* and *Scope*.

1. *"Action"* defines how would like to proceed with remediation in a retest. Within *Action* you can select *Adjust Comparison*, *Be Creative*, *Ignore*, and *Reproduce*. Depending on the *Action* you select you may activate different *Scope* options to choose from.

2. *"Scope"* defines the expected scope that NOVA will apply to the remediation action. Within Scope you can select *Aspect Ratio*, *Device Model* and *Manufacturer*. Depending on the action you select you may activate different scope options to choose from.
